# Webpage Generator
Lightweight tool to automatically create a basic html web page either from a predetermined "default" template or by using text that a user can input into an entry box.

# Check Files GUI
This project allows the user to transfer all files modified recently from their choice of source folder to a destination folder specified.

# Mean or Nice
Simple text game that provides the user a choice about how to treat a stranger that walks up to them, the players fate is ultimately decided by the decisions they make!
